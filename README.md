## Visualization
The dashboards are in form of pdfs and continuation for water accesibilty  project
### National Scale
- For national it will show The map of Majindogo the split between access to water between both rural and urban areas. The total number  of each type of water source for every town counts the different sources by type.
### Visualizing Queues
We will add these plots to the Queues page
 1. Average queue time per hour of the day as a line plot.
 2. Average queue time for each day.
 3. Average queue composition. 
4. Total time queued per province

### Insights from queues
Selecting one of the provinces now filters all of the data by province. We can see that in Amanzi, the average queue is mostly made up of men, while on a national level, it is mostly women. On Saturdays, queues across Maji Ndogo are 40% men, and on Mondays, 71% women. We can even zoom in at 15:00 on a Saturday and see that the queue has only 3% children, while an hour later, the queue has 29% children.
### Connecting crime
The following trend was found 
1. As water collectors, women are twice as likely to be a victim of crime than men. 
2. Women are most likely to be victims of harassment, followed by sexual assault. 
3. Crime spikes over weekends, and almost twice as many crimes are committed early in the mornings or at night with women again facing the greatest threat.

### Report summary
We will  show the following data:
 1. Total people served for each water source type in a province.
 2. Number of water sources, their type, and whether it is rural or urban.
 3. Show the relevant statistics for towns in that province.
 4. Queues, gender compositions, crime, broken taps by town, etc., in provinces where it is relevant.
 5. Summary of improvements and costs.
